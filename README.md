<h1>Introduction to Linear Algebra with Earth Science Applications</h1>

Hello I am Benjamin Loi from CUHK-EESC and NTU-AS. This is the repository for the tex files for my book <em>Introduction to Linear Algebra with Earth Science Applications</em>.

The book pdf is located at [here](Linear_Algebra_Notes_New.pdf).

This project is still alive and being constantly updated as of Nov 2024.

<h2>Contributing to the Project</h2>

Feel free to open an issue regarding any problem or suggestion about the book! Any idea will be greatly appreciated.
When the book is completed, I will upload it to ArXiv formally for open access. This repository will stay anyways.
