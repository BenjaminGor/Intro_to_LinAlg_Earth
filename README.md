<h1>Introduction to Linear Algebra with Earth Science Applications</h1>

Hello, I am Benjamin Loi from CUHK-EESC and NTU-AS. This is the repository for the tex/python files for my book <em>Introduction to Linear Algebra with Earth Science Applications</em>.

<b>The book pdf is located at [here](https://github.com/BenjaminGor/Intro_to_LinAlg_Earth/blob/main/Linear_Algebra_Notes_New.pdf) (First Edition).</b>

Meanwhile, the Jupyter notebooks are placed in [this folder](https://github.com/BenjaminGor/Intro_to_LinAlg_Earth/tree/main/Python%20scripts).

This project has been completed in May 2025.

<h2>Contributing to the Project</h2>

Feel free to open an issue regarding any problem or suggestion about the book! Any idea will be greatly appreciated.
When the book is completed, I will upload it to ArXiv formally for open access. This repository will stay open anyway.
Update: There will be a minor patch to integrate all the comments in the near future.
