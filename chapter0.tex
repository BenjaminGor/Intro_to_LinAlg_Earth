\chapter*{Preface}
This is a Linear Algebra textbook specifically designed for students who are majoring in any Earth Science-related subjects like Geophysics and Atmospheric Sciences, and are also interested in Mathematics. With these target readers in mind, we set out to provide an adequate treatment of Linear Algebra concepts that enables them to tackle relevant Earth Science problems. In each chapter, we focus on a selected Linear Algebra topic, motivated by Earth Science examples and supplemented with Python programming tutorials. At the end of each chapter, a number of exercises are given for elucidating the concepts and working on Earth Science projects. \par

\chapter*{Preface (the Heartfelt Version)}
I have toiled for almost one-and-a-half years to deliver this work. This project started from a small Linear Algebra workshop I gave at CUHK-EESC (previously ESSC) in 2021. The initial draft was only 200 pages long and very immature (same as me back then, lol!). After finishing my Master's degree in 2023 at NTU-AS, I decided to resume the writing of this book. Little did I know at that moment I had taken on a very long and epic journey. In the early beginning, I advanced very quickly, but soon got stuck in the "Saggy Middle". It was absolutely no easy task to produce a Mathematical textbook with 18 chapters, and merely looking at this goal could be disheartening and overwhelming. Sometimes, I struggled to produce even only one page a day. More often than not, I considered the option of giving up, wondering if I really could see the finishing of this work. However, thanks to my stubbornness, I was too proud to kneel: I had a burning desire to finish what I started and show it to the world. Perhaps deep in my heart, I really wanted to get praised for my effort and intelligence, to prove to others that I was a force to be reckoned with. Don't get me wrong, I am still aiming for these rewards. However, along my writer's journey, I have also earned and learned far more precious things and important lessons.

I have become much more resilient and persevering. I disciplined myself to write (almost) every day despite all the ups and downs happening in my life. Many less-than-happy and discouraging events occurred to me, e.g.\ relationships and personal well-being, but I have weathered the storm and come back stronger every time.

I have also become more grateful for the supportive people around me. Without their help, this book (as well as me) would never survive and get to this stage. I guess one of the reasons why I persisted in completing this book was that I did not want to let them down and must return their favors.

Finally, I have realized my true potential and determination. I am much more capable than I ever imagined. For a long time, I was pathetic, but now I have found my passion and dream. I confronted my fear whenever I wrote. I am no longer a little shepherd: I am now a mighty, wise ruler who has managed to overcome Goliath!

I wholeheartedly hope that as you read this book, apart from learning the knowledge of Linear Algebra, you will feel my soul and excitement, appreciate the enormous efforts that were put into it, and have a glimpse of my growth and transformation. So, let me conclude this with a quote.
