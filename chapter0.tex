\chapter*{Preface}
This is a Linear Algebra textbook specifically designed for students who study any Earth Science related major like Geophysics and Atmospheric Sciences. With these target readers in mind, we set out to provide them with a foundation in Linear Algebra that is adequate to deal with relevant Earth Science problems. We have avoided pedantic mathematical details in the book and are instead focusing on practical methods. Therefore, this book is not suitable for training mathematicians. In each chapter, we first discuss a selected Linear Algebra topic. Then we will move on to some Earth Science examples about that topic if possible. It is followed up by another section which demonstrates how coding in Python may help us solve these Linear Algebra problems. At the end of each chapter, a number of exercises are given for practices, and it can be done either by hand or programming. It is suggested that the readers install the newest version of Python via Anaconda. \par
