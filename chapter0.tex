\chapter*{Preface}
This is a Linear Algebra textbook specifically designed for students that are majoring in any Earth Science related subjects like Geophysics and Atmospheric Sciences, who are also interested in Mathematics. With these target readers in mind, we set out to provide an adequate treatment about Linear Algebra concepts that enables them to tackle relevant Earth Science problems. In each chapter, we focus on a selected Linear Algebra topic, motivated by Earth Science examples and supplemented with Python programming tutorials. At the end of each chapter, a number of exercises are given for elucidating the concepts and working on Earth Science projects. \par
